### Task 1: Environment Setup and Foundational Learning on Azure

#### üìö Foundational Learning
To ensure a solid foundation for this task, I first completed the relevant Microsoft Learn modules, passing all assessments:
- Introduction to Microsoft Azure Data non-relational data in Azure 
   - Explore Azure Storage for non-relational data (Azure blob storage,Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft OneLake in Fabric, Azure Storage account.)
   - Explore fundamentals of Azure Cosmos DB

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Actions Performed
- Created **Resource group** to serve as a logical container for all the project's resources. This is a fundamental cloud best practice for organizing, managing, and controlling the lifecycle (deployment, updates, deletion) of a solution's components as a single unit.
