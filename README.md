# ðŸš— Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Project â€“ Misk x Microsoft

This repository contains my project for the **"Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"** virtual work experience program, a collaboration between **Misk Foundation** and **Microsoft**.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where I acted as an **AI Software Developer** for a client in the **automotive trade sector**. The goal was to leverage the **Microsoft Azure** cloud platform to build data-driven solutions that enhance user experience and support business decisions.


## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The project was structured into multiple hands-on tasks, each designed to simulate real-world scenarios in data science and AI:

1. **Azure Workspace Setup**  
   - Created and configured **Azure Data Factory**.  
   - Set up **Azure Storage Account** for data storage and management.

2. **Data Analysis for Decision Support**  
   - Processed and analyzed datasets to generate actionable insights.  
   - Applied statistical and visualization techniques to support decision-making.

3. **AI Model Development with Custom Vision**  
   - Built an innovative computer vision model using **Azure Custom Vision**.  
   - Trained and tested the model on a labeled dataset.

4. **Machine Learning Model with Azure ML**  
   - Developed and deployed a machine learning model using **Azure Machine Learning**.  
   - Evaluated model performance and optimized parameters.
